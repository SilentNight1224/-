I built a long short-term memory neural network model (LSTM) to predict the user's electricity consumption behavior
according to the daily electricity price data under the tensorflow framework. I also introduced attention mechanism of time
mode to improve the accuracy of the model. The simulation results verify the advantages of the learning model compared to
the traditional deep learning model, which is helpful for retailers to formulate personalized electricity price scheme for
agreement users.
